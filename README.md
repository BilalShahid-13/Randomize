# Randomizer Pro JS

A JavaScript package to generate random colors and numbers.

## Installation

You can install `randomizer-pro-js` via npm:

```bash
npm install randomizer-pro-js
```

Available Functions getRandomNumber(min, max)

Generates a random integer between min (inclusive) and max (inclusive).

Parameters: min (number): The minimum value. max (number): The maximum value.

Returns:
number: A random integer between min and max.
const randomNumber = getRandomNumber(1, 10);
console.log(randomNumber);

However, you don't need to use triple backticks twice. The first triple backticks (```) are enough to format the code example. The second triple backticks are not necessary.

But if you want to use triple backticks twice, you can do that. Just make sure to specify the language identifier (in this case, `javascript`) after the first triple backticks, like this: ```javascript. This will help with syntax highlighting and make the code example look nicer.
